        <h1>Controls Sim Project</h1>
        <p>Controls Sim is a web-based application to simulate and visualize several dynamic systems and controllers. I created this as an educational tool for exploring control systems and to experiment with simulation and control methods.</p>

        <p> The website is built with Dash, a python library for turing Plotly based plots into web pages. It is hosted using hugging face. The main simulation is performed using fixed step Runge-Kutta 4th order. The current support controllers are SISO PID and MIMO Full state Feedback with Pole placement. More controllers and state estimators coming soon.</p>

        <p>This project is a continuous work in progress and some of the tasks I am hoping to tackle in the near future are outlined in the GITHUB. Some key tasks I am hoping to complete soon is the addition of noise to my system and Kalman filter. Additionally I want to add some more interesting non linear systems such as spacecraft dynamics, an inverted pendulum, and a drone.</p>
